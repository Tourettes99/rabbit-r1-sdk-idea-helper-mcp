## Troubleshooting

### MCP Server Not Working

1. Check if Node.js is installed:
   ```powershell
   node --version
   ```

2. Check logs:
   ```powershell
   Get-Content "C:\Users\isman\Documents\rabbit r1 sdk mcp\rabbit-ideas-mcp\startup.log"
   ```

3. Restart Cursor completely

4. Check mcp.json configuration at: `C:\Users\isman\.cursor\mcp.json`

### Ideas Are Repeating

This shouldn't happen, but if it does:
1. Check if `rabbit-ideas-storage.json` exists
2. Verify the file has write permissions
3. Check the file contents to see if ideas are being saved

### Want to Clear Idea History

In Cursor, ask:
- "Clear my Rabbit R1 idea history" (the assistant will confirm)

Or manually delete: `rabbit-ideas-storage.json`

## Uninstall

Run the uninstall script:
```powershell
cd "C:\Users\isman\Documents\rabbit r1 sdk mcp\rabbit-ideas-mcp"
.\uninstall.ps1
```

Or manually:
1. Delete the startup shortcut from: `%APPDATA%\Microsoft\Windows\Start Menu\Programs\Startup\`
2. Remove the `rabbit-r1-ideas` entry from `mcp.json`
3. Delete the MCP server folder
