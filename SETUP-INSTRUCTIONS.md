# Rabbit R1 Ideas MCP Server - Setup Instructions

## What This Does

This MCP server enhances your AI assistant with the ability to:
- Generate 20 unique Rabbit R1 creation app ideas per request
- Never repeat previously suggested ideas (they're saved to memory)
- Monitor the [Rabbit R1 Creations SDK](https://github.com/rabbit-hmi-oss/creations-sdk.git) for latest features
- Fetch a **unified index** of official GitHub + npm [`r1-create`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/r1-create) in one MCP call (`get_rabbit_sdk_knowledge_index`)
- Help you iterate and improve on previous ideas
- Retrieve and search through previously suggested ideas

## Installation Steps

## File Locations

- **MCP Server**: your clone of `rabbit-ideas-mcp/`
- **Cursor MCP config**: `~/.cursor/mcp.json` (macOS/Linux) or `%USERPROFILE%\.cursor\mcp.json` (Windows)
- **Ideas + SDK cache**: `rabbit-ideas-storage.json` (in MCP server directory; gitignored by default)
- **Windows only — Startup Link**: `%APPDATA%\Microsoft\Windows\Start Menu\Programs\Startup\RabbitR1Ideas.lnk`
- **Logs**: `startup.log` (in MCP server directory, Windows optional flow)

## Troubleshooting

### MCP Server Not Working

1. Check if Node.js is installed:
   ```powershell
   node --version
   ```

2. Check logs:
   ```powershell
   Get-Content "C:\Users\isman\Documents\rabbit r1 sdk mcp\rabbit-ideas-mcp\startup.log"
   ```

3. Restart Cursor completely

4. Check mcp.json configuration at: `C:\Users\isman\.cursor\mcp.json`

### Ideas Are Repeating

This shouldn't happen, but if it does:
1. Check if `rabbit-ideas-storage.json` exists
2. Verify the file has write permissions
3. Check the file contents to see if ideas are being saved

### Want to Clear Idea History

In Cursor, ask:
- "Clear my Rabbit R1 idea history" (the assistant will confirm)

Or manually delete: `rabbit-ideas-storage.json`

## Uninstall

Run the uninstall script:
```powershell
cd "C:\Users\isman\Documents\rabbit r1 sdk mcp\rabbit-ideas-mcp"
.\uninstall.ps1
```

Or manually:
1. Delete the startup shortcut from: `%APPDATA%\Microsoft\Windows\Start Menu\Programs\Startup\`
2. Remove the `rabbit-r1-ideas` entry from `mcp.json`
3. Delete the MCP server folder
